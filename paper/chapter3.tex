\section{Reward Machines}

\begin{notes}
    write this after chapter 1 (15-20 pages)

    use following papers:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item original reward machine paper from 2018 \cite{RM2018}
        \item connection to LTL from 2019 \cite{LTL2019}
        \item newer reward machine paper from 2022 \cite{RM2022}
    \end{itemize}

    maybe relevant papers:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item connection to symbolic planning from 2019 \cite{SP2019}
        \item reward machines for partially observable RL from 2019 \cite{PORL2019}
    \end{itemize}

    include updated RL framework graph to better differentiate that reward machines are not in the environment black box

    include same task from previous chapter and how a reward machine for that might look like as a graph

    include comparison graphs to standard algorithms
