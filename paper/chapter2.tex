\section{Background on Reinforcement Learning}

\begin{notes}
    write this first (10-15 pages)

    include RL framework graph with agent and environment and include example of a typical RL task

    preliminaries to cover:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item MDP
        \item policy
        \item q function
        \item Bellman equations
        \item (off-policy) (tabular) q learning
        \item proofs of standard dynamic programming solutions
        \item DQN
        \item off-policy actor-critic approach: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
    \end{itemize}
