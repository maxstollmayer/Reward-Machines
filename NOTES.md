# Thesis Notes

## Todos

- send professor little bits to read and discuss
- ? upload all pdfs to grok for querying
- program a simple reward machine
- change title in hyperref and title page
- make title page (univie template?)
- turn off colorlinks
- definition/theorem package?

## Questions

- What citation style should the thesis use?
- Should the thesis cover partially obersable RL or symbolic planning?
- Can Turing Machines (or equivalent) be used instead of DFA?
- Can natural language be used or translated into reward specification or reward machines?
- Can functional logic programming be used to specify a reward machine? See [podcast](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy56ZW5jYXN0ci5jb20vZi9vU24xaTMxNi5yc3M/episode/ZjM2NzgwZDAtYWVjNC00N2QwLWJlYjMtNjg5ZWMzNjk2NTEy)
- Is there a measure of equivalence of reward machines? Can we learn equivalent reward machines from a given one?
- Can a reward machine be decomposed into smaller reward machines? Can these be of a "lower rank"? Could these be used for a hierarchical RL algorithm?
